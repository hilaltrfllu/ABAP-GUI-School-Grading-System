3)Create include files ztest_prog_o01(PBO process before include ztest_prog_o01) and ztest_prog_a01(PAI process after include file)
4)Uncomment the commented part in screen 1000 and double click on STATUS_1000(to create PBO module remember to associate include file ztest_prog_o01 file). similarly double click on USER_COMMAND_1000 (to create PAI module remember to associate include file ztest_prog_a01 file).
